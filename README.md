Measurements of parity violation in electron-proton scattering have provided information on a wide variety of important topics, from the determination of Standard Model couplings to important aspects regarding nucleon structure, previously not available. Among the latter we find the extraction of the strange quark contributions to the proton structure. Although  several  studies  regarding  parity-violating observables  have  been  carried out in recent years, corrections to the theoretical models are still being developed. A correction that is fairly novel is the energy-dependent $\gamma Z$-box correction which was previously taken as a constant. Therefore, there are not many studies available that can help us understand the impact of this correction.
